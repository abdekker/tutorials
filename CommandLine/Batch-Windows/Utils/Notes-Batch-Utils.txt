General-purpose batch utilities

Notes and usage details:
* These scripts generally work together so should be kept together
* Copy this entire folder to your target Windows system (eg. C:\Work\Scripts)
* To ensure the scripts are usable do one of the following:
    - Add this folder to your system path
    - Create an enviroment variable to point to this path (eg. DEV_SCRIPTS=C:\Work\Scripts)
        - Scripts can then be called with something like: "call %DEV_SCRIPTS%\MyScript.bat"
