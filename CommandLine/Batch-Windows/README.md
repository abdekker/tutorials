These scripts show general usage of variables, functions, etc in DOS batch scripting.
See the Commands folder for more detailed notes on specific DOS commands or utilities.

There is (currently) no VS Code extension that allows debugging of DOS scripts.

General note about running DOS scripts on Windows

* Option 1: Run directly from Windows Explorer
    - Usually requires a "pause" if you wish to debug the script

* Option 2: Run from the in-built Terminal of VS Code

* Option 3: Run in an external command line window
    - Probably the most convenient for debugging

Case sensitivity

* DOS commands are case insensitive, so "cd" is equivalent to "CD"
* Because of this, commands are sometimes written UPPERCASE and data and variables written lowercase
