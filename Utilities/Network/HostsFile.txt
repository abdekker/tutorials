Windows comes with a special "hosts" file which helps resolving DNS records. In addition to your network configuration, the file can be used to define a "domain=IP address" pairing which will have priority above the value provided by the DNS server. Using this trick, you can block certain web sites from opening in the web browser on your computer.

* To edit hosts
	- Start the editor in Administrator mode
	- Open C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts from within the editor

* Comments start with a hash (#) symbol

* To block a website
	- Add a new line with "127.0.0.1 WEBSITE.com"
	- Example:
		127.0.0.1	google.com
		127.0.0.1	www.facebook.com
		127.0.0.1	play.chessbase.com
	- To test, open a command prompt and type "ping WEBSITE.com"
		- Note: This won't work if the website does not respond to ICMP echo requests
