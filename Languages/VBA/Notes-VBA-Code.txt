### VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) ###
* Programming language for Microsoft Office (in particular Excel)
	- This file describes coding in VBA (and the code in this repository)
	- This file does not discuss enabling VBA or using the Visual Basic Editor in Office applications
		- See <PEN-DRIVE>\Work\Utilities\Microsoft\Office\VBA\Notes-VBA.txt for general notes on VBA in Office

* To use the VBA code in an Office application
	- Excel and Word 16.0 (Office 365)
		- Open Workbook or Document (either existing or blank)
		- View the Visual Basic Editor
			- Alt+F11, Quick Access > Visual Basic Editor, View > Macros > Edit
		- In Project Explorer, right-click the project (probably called "VBAProject") and select Insert > Module
		- Paste in the code (and edit as required)
		- Run directly from the Visual Basic Editor or return to the workbook and run the macro from there

* Notes on project references
	- To work with specific technologies, such as DAO, the project may need to include references to external COM assemblies
	- Select Tools > References
	- Scroll down the list and select the reference(s) required
	- Common requirements include:
		- Working with Microsoft Access databases and the JET engine:
			- Microsoft ADO Ext. 2.8 for DDL and Security
