* Data in RDBMS (Relation Database Management System) databases are stored in objects called tables
* Tables collected related data entries and consist of columns and rows
* Every table consists of fields, designed to maintain specific information about every record in the table
* A record, also called a row, is each individual entry in the table. A record is a horizontal entity in the table.
* A column is a vertical entity in the table and contains all information associated with a specific field in a table

* SQL verbs and names are case-insensitive
	- So the following would be equivalent:
		"SELECT * FROM Customers"
		"select * from cUsToMeRs"
	- But by convention: Write verbs in UPPERCASE, and table/column names in PascalCase (and avoid spaces)

### SQL VERBS ###
* SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY
	$ SELECT * FROM Customers;
		- Select all columns from the Customers table
	$ SELECT CustomerName, Address, Country FROM Customers;
		- Select only the "CustomerName", "Address" and "Country" colums
	$ SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE Country = 'Germany';
		- Select all colums where the Country is listed as "Germany"
	$ SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS ORDER BY City ASC;
		- Select all columns, order ascending by the "City" column
	$ SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE Country = 'Germany' ORDER BY City DESC
		- Select all columns where the Country is listed as "Germany", order descending by the "City" column

	$ SELECT Country FROM Customers
		- Returns values from the "Country" column
	$ SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers
		- Returns only distinct values from the "Country" column
#

* INSERT INTO, IS NULL, IS NOT NULL
	$ INSERT INTO Customers
		(CustomerID,CustomerName,ContactName,Address,City,PostalCode,Country)
		VALUES (92,'Name','Contact','SomeAddress','BigCity','GU4 7HF','BigCountry')
		- Inserts a record into the database
		- If a column (eg. Customers.CustomerID) has an UNIQUE constraint this can fail
		- And if a column (eg. Customers.ColumnID) has the "AutoInc" type, then it can be omitted

	$ INSERT INTO Customers
		(CustomerID,CustomerName,ContactName,City,Country)
		VALUES (93,'Frank','Frankly','SmallCity','SmallCountry')
		- Inserts a record, with NULL values for the "Address" and "PostalCode" columns

	$ SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Address IS NULL
		- Return the above inserted record
	$ SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Address IS NOT NULL
		- Returns all other records
#

*  UPDATE
	$ UPDATE Customers
		SET ContactName='Alfred Schmidt', City='Frankfurt'
		WHERE CustomerID=1
		- Modify some values of the record which has a CustomerID of "1"

	$ UPDATE Customers
		SET CustomerName='New Name'
		WHERE CustomerName='Old Name'
		- Similar, but updating a specific value (in this case, the customer name)
