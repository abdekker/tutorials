### General notes about .gitignore files ###
# 	All lines beginning with "#" are comments
# 	If you wish to define a pattern which begins with "#", put a backslash "\" in front
# 	Blank lines are ignored, so can act as separators
# 	"!" negates a pattern, so any file excluded by a previous pattern will be included again
# 	"/" is a directory separator; if placed at the end of a pattern, only directories are matched
#	"*" is a wildcard for any number of characters
#	"?" is a wildcard for specifically one character
#	"[a-zA-Z]" is an example of range notation and is used to match one of the characters in a range

# Examples:
#	Pattern		Matches
#	hello.*		"hello.txt", "hello.c" in any directory
#	/hello.*	"hello.txt", "hello.c" but not "a/hello.java"
#	build/		Any directory called "build" along with its contents
