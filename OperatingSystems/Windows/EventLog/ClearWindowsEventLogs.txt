Clearing the Windows Event logs

### Command Prompt (recommended) ###
- Open an elevated command prompt
- Run the following command:
	for /F "tokens=*" %1 in ('wevtutil.exe el') DO wevtutil.exe cl "%1"
- The event logs will now be cleared. You can close the command prompt when it's finished.
#

### PowerShell ###
- Open an elevated Windows PowerShell
- Run the following command:
	Get-WinEvent -ListLog * | where {$_.RecordCount} | ForEach-Object -Process { [System.Diagnostics.Eventing.Reader.EventLogSession]::GlobalSession.ClearLog($_.LogName) }
OR
	Get-EventLog -LogName * | ForEach { Clear-EventLog $_.Log } 
OR
	wevtutil el | Foreach-Object {wevtutil cl "$_"}
- The event logs will now be cleared. You can close PowerShell when it's finished.
